# Title: Unethical Retailers' Hosts
# Author: Colby Weil
#
# This hosts file contains domains owned by unethical retailers. The goal of
#   blocking these sites is to make it easier to avoid purchasing products
#   from unethical companies. Or at least to make it take conscious effort
#   by requiring these sites to be added to an allowlist.
#
# Only the domain hosting the retailer's store will be blocked (usually
#   starting with www). This should make it a bit easier to add specific sites
#   to an allowlist.
